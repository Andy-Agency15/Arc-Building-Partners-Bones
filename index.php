Theme Header & Custom Template
Code ∙ Version 2
Perfect! I've created a comprehensive WordPress starter theme for you with all the features you requested. Here's what I've built:

What's Included:
1. Core Theme Files
functions.php - Complete setup with GSAP, ACF, and Gravity Forms integration
Template files - index.php, header.php, footer.php, single.php, page.php
Custom post types - Portfolio and Testimonials examples
Custom taxonomies - Portfolio categories
Helper functions - ACF field helpers, pagination, image sizes
2. SCSS Structure
Organized folder structure (config, base, layout, components, pages, wordpress, utilities)
Variables and mixins for consistent styling
CodeKit-ready configuration
Much cleaner than Underscores/Understrap
3. JavaScript & GSAP Integration
Mobile menu with GSAP animations
Scroll-triggered animations using ScrollTrigger
Smooth scrolling, lazy loading, page transitions
Gravity Forms integration
Performance optimized with debounce/throttle functions
4. Custom Templates
page-custom.php - Flexible page template with ACF field groups
archive-portfolio.php - Custom post type archive with filtering
single-portfolio.php - Individual portfolio item template
Hero sections, two-column layouts, image galleries, contact forms
5. Git Workflow Setup
Complete .gitignore file
GitKraken and VS Code integration guide
Branch strategy and commit conventions
Deployment workflow
Team collaboration guidelines
Key Features:
✅ GSAP Integration - Ready for animations and interactions
✅ ACF Support - Theme options page and custom fields
✅ Gravity Forms - CSS disabled for custom styling
✅ SCSS/CodeKit - Organized file structure and compilation
✅ Custom Menus - Primary, footer, and mobile navigation
✅ Custom Post Types - Portfolio and testimonials examples
✅ Gutenberg Ready - Block editor support for future use
✅ Clean & Minimal - Much leaner than existing themes
✅ Git Workflow - Complete setup and documentation

Next Steps:
Create the theme folder in /wp-content/themes/starter-theme/
Copy the files from the artifacts above
Set up the SCSS folder structure as outlined
Initialize Git repository following the workflow guide
Configure CodeKit with the provided settings
Create ACF field groups for the custom page template
Add your styles to the SCSS partials
This gives you a solid foundation that's much cleaner than Underscores/Understrap while still providing all the functionality you need. You can easily add features as your projects require them.

Would you like me to create any specific SCSS partials, ACF field configurations, or additional template files?




just testing. no way you could create a zip for me to download could you?

Edit
Unfortunately, I can't create downloadable zip files or packages. The artifacts I create are text-based content that you can copy and paste, but I don't have the ability to generate actual file downloads or compressed archives.

However, I can make this easier for you! Here are a few options:

Option 1: Create a GitHub Repository
I could help you set up all the files in a structured way that you can easily copy into a new GitHub repository, then clone it locally.

Option 2: Step-by-Step File Creation Guide
I could create a detailed guide showing exactly which files to create and where, with all the content organized by file.

Option 3: Individual File Artifacts
I could break down each major file (functions.php, style.css, scripts.js, etc.) into separate artifacts that are easier to copy one by one.

Quick Setup Process:
Create your theme folder: /wp-content/themes/starter-theme/
Copy the functions.php content from the first artifact
Create the SCSS folder structure and copy the style.scss content
Copy the template files (header.php, footer.php, etc.)
Set up the JavaScript file
Initialize Git following the workflow guide
Would you like me to reorganize this into a more step-by-step format, or would you prefer one of the other options? I could also create a shell script that would help automate the file creation process locally.
